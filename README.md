# CS-255
This term has been a deep dive into systems analysis and design, and the DriverPass project gave me a solid chance to apply everything we’ve covered. From the early requirements gathering to the final system architecture, I’ve seen how each phase of the SDLC builds on the last and how critical it is to stay organized and intentional throughout.

The Business Requirements Document helped me lock down the core functionality: secure student registration, lesson scheduling, instructor feedback, and progress tracking. I focused on making the system intuitive for non-technical users, especially students and parents, while ensuring it met performance and security standards like multi-factor authentication and encrypted communication.

In the System Design Document, I used UML diagrams to visualize how users interact with the system. The use case and activity diagrams clarified the flow of booking lessons and taking practice exams, while the class and sequence diagrams helped me define object relationships and system behavior. These tools weren’t just academic. They made the system easier to explain and refine.

One thing I’d recommend for future maintenance is a built-in issue reporting tool that feeds into a ticketing system. It would help admins prioritize bugs and feature requests without relying on email chains or manual tracking. I also emphasized adaptability in the design, like allowing admins to modify training packages without touching code.

Being a good team member in system development means documenting clearly, communicating proactively, and designing with future scalability in mind. I tried to reflect that in every part of the project. This course didn’t just teach me how to build a system. It taught me how to think like a systems analyst.

I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited to carry these skills into the field. One step closer to graduation and doing it the right way.
